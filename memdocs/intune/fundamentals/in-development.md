# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description will move from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

## App management

### Added protection for iOS/iPadOS app widgets<!-- 14614429 -->

To protect organizational data for MAM managed accounts and apps, Intune app protection policies now provide the capability to block data sync from policy managed app data to app widgets. App widgets can be added to end-user's iOS/iPadOS device lock screen, which can expose data contained by these widgets, such as meeting titles, top sites, and recent notes. In Intune, you'll be able to set the app protection policy setting **Sync policy managed app data with app widgets** to **Block** for iOS/iPadOS apps. This setting will be available as part of the **Data Protection** settings in app protection policies. This new setting will be an app protection feature similar to the **Sync policy managed app data with native app or add-ins** setting.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

<!-- ## Device configuration -->


<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device enrollment  

### Support ending for Apple User Enrollment with Company Portal<!-- 28361917 -->

After the release of iOS/iPadOS 18, Apple will no longer support profile-based Apple User Enrollment. As a result, Intune will end support for [user enrollment with Company Portal](../enrollment/apple-user-enrollment-with-company-portal.md) shortly after the release of iOS/iPadOS 18.

After Intune ends support for user enrollment with Company Portal:

- Existing enrolled devices won't be impacted.
- Users won't be able to enroll devices if they're targeted with this enrollment profile type.
- Microsoft Intune technical support will be available for existing enrolled devices with this enrollment profile type. Technical support won't be available for new enrollments.

To prepare, use a different management method to enroll devices. We recommend account-driven Apple User Enrollment for similar functionality and an improved user experience. For a simpler enrollment experience, try web- based device enrollment. For more information, see:

- [Set up account-driven Apple User Enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md)
- [Set up web-based device enrollment for iOS/iPadOS](../enrollment/web-based-device-enrollment-ios.md)

## Device management

### Intune will support macOS 13.x as the minimum version<!-- 28391869 -->

With Apple's release of macOS 15 Sequoia, Microsoft Intune, the Company Portal app, and the Intune MDM agent will now require macOS 13 (Big Sur) and later.

For more information on this change, see [Plan for change: Intune is moving to support macOS 13 and later](../fundamentals/whats-new.md#plan-for-change-intune-is-moving-to-support-macos-13-and-higher-later-this-year).

> [!NOTE]
> macOS devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. For more information, see [Support statement](https://aka.ms/Intune/macOS/ADE-DE-support).

Applies to:

- macOS

### Intune supports iOS/iPadOS 16.x as the minimum version<!-- 28391935 -->

Later this year, we expect iOS18 and iPadOS 18 to be released by Apple. Microsoft Intune, including the Intune Company Portal and Intune app protection policies (APP, also known as MAM), will require iOS/iPadOS 16 and higher shortly after the iOS/iPadOS 18 release.

For more information on this change, see [Plan for change: Intune is moving to support iOS/iPadOS 16 and later](../fundamentals/whats-new.md#plan-for-change-intune-is-moving-to-support-iosipados-16-and-later).

> [!NOTE]
> Userless iOS and iPadOS devices enrolled through Automated Device Enrollment (ADE) have a slightly nuanced support statement due to their shared usage. For more information, see [Support statement for supported versus allowed iOS/iPadOS versions for user-less devices](https://aka.ms/ADE_userless_support).

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

## Device security

### Defender for Endpoint security settings support in government cloud environments<!-- 24191406 -->

Customer tenants in US Government Community Cloud (GCC) High, and Department of Defense (DoD) environments will soon be able to use Intune to manage the Defender security settings on the devices youâ€™ve onboarded to Defender without enrolling those devices with Intune. This capability is known as [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md).

For more information about the Intune features supported in GCC High and DoD environments, see [Intune US Government service description](../fundamentals/intune-govt-service-description.md).

### Support for Intune Device control policy for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 15466620 -->

You'll be able to use the endpoint security policy for *Device control* (Attack surface reduction policy) from the Microsoft Intune with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Device control** policies are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md).

Applies to the following when you use the *Windows 10, Windows 11, and Windows Server* platform:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

When this change takes effect, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive this policy will get it.
