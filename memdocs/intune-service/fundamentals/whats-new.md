#### New settings for Windows LAPS policy<!-- 30287386 -->

Intune policies for [Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS)](../protect/windows-laps-overview.md) now include several new settings and updates to two previously available settings. Use of [LAPS](/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-overview) which is a Windows built-in solution can help you secure the built-in local administrator account that is present on each Windows device. All the settings that you can manage through Intune LAPS policy are described in the Windows [LAPS CSP](/windows/client-management/mdm/LAPS-csp).

The following new settings are available: *(Each setting name is a link that opens the CSP documentation for that setting.)*

- [Automatic Account Management Enable Account](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp#policiesautomaticaccountmanagementenableaccount)
- [Automatic Account Management Enabled](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp#policiesautomaticaccountmanagementenabled)  
- [Automatic Account Management Name Or Prefix](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp#policiesautomaticaccountmanagementnameorprefix)

  - Passphrase (long words)
  - Passphrase (short words)
  - Passphrase (short words with unique prefixes)
- [Post Authentication Actions](/windows/client-management/mdm/laps-csp#policiespostauthenticationactions) - The following option is now available for this setting:
  - Reset the password, logoff the managed account, and terminate any remaining processes: upon expiration of the grace period, the managed account password is reset, any interactive logon sessions using the managed account are logged off, and any remaining processes are terminated.

By default, each setting in LAPS policies is set to *Not configured*, which means the addition of these new settings won't change the behavior of your existing policies. To make use of the new settings and options, you can create new profiles or edit your existing profiles.

At Apple WWDC 2024, Apple ended support for profile-based Apple user enrollment. For more information, see [Support has ended for profile-based user enrollment with Company Portal](../fundamentals/whats-new-archive.md#support-has-ended-for-apple-profile-based-user-enrollment-with-company-portal). As a result of this change, we updated the behavior that occurs when you select **Determine based on user choice** as the enrollment profile type for bring-your-own-device (BYOD) enrollments.

Now when users select **I own this device** during a BYOD enrollment, Microsoft Intune enrolls them via account-driven user enrollment, rather than profile-based user enrollment, and then secures only work-related apps. Less than one percent of Apple devices across all Intune tenants are currently enrolled this way, so this change doesn't affect most enrolled devices. There is no change for iOS users who select **My company owns this device** during a BYOD enrollment. Intune enrolls them via device enrollment with Intune Company Portal, and then secures their entire device.

If you currently allow users in BYOD scenarios to determine their enrollment profile type, you must take action to ensure account-driven user enrollment works by completing all prerequisites. For more information, see [Set up account driven Apple user enrollment](../enrollment/apple-account-driven-user-enrollment.md). If you don't give users the option to choose their enrollment profile type, there are no action items.

Specific UI improvements are focused on the **Home**, **Devices**, and **Downloads & updates** pages. The new design is more intuitive and highlights areas where users need to take action.

For more information, see [New look for Intune Company Portal app for Windows](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/intune-customer-success/new-look-for-intune-company-portal-app-for-windows/ba-p/4158755). For end user details, see [Install and share apps on your device](../user-help/install-apps-cpapp-windows.md).

### Device security

#### New strong mapping requirements for SCEP certificates authenticating with KDC<!-- 29005591 -->

The Key Distribution Center (KDC) requires user or device objects to be strongly mapped to Active Directory for certificate-based authentication. This means that a Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) certificate's subject alternative name (SAN) must have a security identifier (SID) extension that maps to the user or device SID in Active Directory. The mapping requirement protects against certificate spoofing and ensures that certificate-based authentication against the KDC continues working.

To meet requirements, modify or create a SCEP certificate profile in Microsoft Intune. Then add a `URI` attribute and the `OnPremisesSecurityIdentifier` variable to the SAN. After you do that, Microsoft Intune appends a tag with the SID extension to the SAN and issues new certificates to targeted users and devices. If the user or device has a SID on premises that's synced to Microsoft Entra ID, the certificate shows the SID. If they don't have a SID, a new certificate is issued without the SID.

For more information and steps, see [Update certificate connector: Strong mapping requirements for KB5014754](../protect/certificates-profile-scep.md).

Applies to:

- Windows 10/11, iOS/iPadOS, and macOS user certificates
- Windows 10/11 device certificates

This requirement isn't applicable to device certificates used with Microsoft Entra joined users or devices, because the SID attribute is an on-premises identifier.

#### Defender for Endpoint security settings support in government cloud environments (public preview)<!-- 24191406 -->

In public preview, customer tenants in US Government Community (GCC) High, and Department of Defense (DoD) environments can now use Intune to manage the Defender security settings on the devices that onboarded to Defender without enrolling those devices with Intune. This capability is known as [Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md).

For more information about the Intune features supported in GCC High and DoD environments, see [Intune US Government service description](../fundamentals/intune-govt-service-description.md).

### Device security

#### Updates to PKCS certificate issuance process in Microsoft Intune Certificate Connector, version 6.2406.0.1001 <!-- 24186560 -->

We updated the process for Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS) certificate issuance in Microsoft Intune to support the security identifiers (SID) information requirements described in [KB5014754](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16). As part of this update, an OID attribute containing the user or device SID is added to the certificate. This change is available with the Certificate Connector for Microsoft Intune, version 6.2406.0.1001, and applies to users and devices synced from Active Directory on-premises to Microsoft Entra ID.

The SID update is available for user certificates across all platforms, and for device certificates specifically on Microsoft Entra hybrid joined Windows devices.

For more information, see:

- [What's new for the certificate connector](../protect/certificate-connector-overview.md#september-19-2024)
