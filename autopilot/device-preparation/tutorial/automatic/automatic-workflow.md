# Step by step tutorial for Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode in Intune

This step by step tutorial guides through using Intune to perform a Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode.

The purpose of this tutorial is a step by step guide for all the configuration steps required for a successful Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode deployment using Intune. The tutorial is also designed as a walkthrough in a lab or testing scenario, but can be expanded for use in a production environment.

Before beginning, refer to the [How to: Plan your Microsoft Entra join implementation](/azure/active-directory/devices/azureadjoin-plan) to make sure all requirements are met for joining devices to Microsoft Entra ID.

## Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode overview

[Windows 365 Frontline Cloud PC in shared mode](/windows-365/enterprise/autopilot-device-preparation) builds upon the flexible licensing and usage model of Windows 365 Frontline by enabling the provisioning of shared Cloud PCs for groups of users to access on an occasional or part-time basis.

Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode, also known as Windows Autopilot device preparation automatic mode, is a solution that adds an additional Windows Autopilot device preparation profile that can be included in Windows 365 Frontline shared provisioning policies. By including the Windows Autopilot device preparation profile in the Windows 365 Frontline shared provisioning policies, it ensures that essential required device-targeted apps and scripts in Intune are installed on shared Cloud PCs during the provisioning process before the user signs in. This feature helps increase standardization of shared Cloud PCs while reducing the management overhead that comes with IT admins creating and managing their own custom images with pre-installed applications.

Windows Autopilot device preparation tracks the installation progress of specified Intune applications and scripts during Cloud PC provisioning. Instead of marking Cloud PCs as "provisioned" after Intune enrollment, Windows Autopilot device preparation and Windows 365 wait until those workloads are fully installed. IT admins will see a new status of **Preparing** reflected in the console while device preparation is underway.

Windows Autopilot device preparation automatic deployments performs the following tasks during the deployment:

- Joins the device to Microsoft Entra ID.
- Enrolls the device in Intune.
- Installs up to 10 essential applications.
- Runs up to 10 essential PowerShell scripts.

Once the Windows Autopilot device preparation automatic deployment is complete, the Cloud PC is ready for the end-user to use.

## Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode process

During the out-of-box experience (OOBE), a user authenticates with their corporate credentials. If there's a Windows Autopilot device preparation policy assigned to the user signing in, then that policy is delivered to the device. It then determines the configuration that needs to be applied to the device based on the settings configured in the policy. After that, device setup continues in the following order:

1. The Cloud PC joins Microsoft Entra ID and enrolls in Intune.

1. The Intune management extension installs.

1. When the device is joined to Microsoft Entra ID during the first step, the user is automatically added to the local **Administrators** group on the device. If the user account is configured as a standard user, the setting is enforced by removing the user out of the **Administrators** group.

1. The deployment syncs with the mobile device management (MDM) service such as Intune and checks if line-of-business (LOB) and Microsoft 365 applications are selected in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. It also syncs all MDM policy at this time, but application of the policy isn't tracked during the deployment.

1. If there are LOB and Microsoft 365 applications selected in the policy, then they're installed. If a LOB or Microsoft 365 application fails to install, then the deployment fails at this point.

1. The deployment checks if PowerShell scripts are selected in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. If there are PowerShell scripts selected in the policy, then they run. If a PowerShell script fails, then the deployment fails at this point.

1. The deployment checks if Win32 and Microsoft Store applications are selected in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. If there are Win32 and Microsoft Store applications selected in the policy, then they're installed. If a Win32 or Microsoft Store application fails to install, then the deployment fails at this point.

1. If all steps succeed, the **Required setup complete** page is displayed for the user.

1. Once the **Required setup complete** page is dismissed, the user is automatically signed in and the desktop is displayed.

1. At this point, another sync is triggered and all other configurations is delivered to the device. Additional configurations might include:

    - Applications and PowerShell scripts that were assigned to the device group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy but weren't explicitly selected in the policy.
    - Any additional MDM policy.
    - User-based configurations.

## Workflow

The following steps are needed to configure and then perform a Windows Autopilot device preparation in automatic mode for Windows 365 Frontline in shared mode in Intune:

> - Step 1: [Set up Windows automatic Intune enrollment](automatic-automatic-enrollment.md)
> - Step 2: [Allow users to join devices to Microsoft Entra ID](automatic-allow-users-to-join.md)
> - Step 3: [Create an assigned device group](automatic-device-group.md)
> - Step 4: [Assign applications and PowerShell scripts to device group](automatic-assign-apps-scripts.md)
> - Step 5: [Create Windows Autopilot device preparation policy](automatic-autopilot-policy.md)
> - Step 6: [Create a Cloud PC provisioning policy](automatic-cloud-pc-provisioning-policy.md)

> [!NOTE]
