> [!NOTE]
>
> The user group created in this step is specific to Windows Autopilot device preparation. Microsoft recommends creating a user group specifically for use with Windows Autopilot device preparation instead of reusing existing user groups used in other Windows Autopilot scenarios.

## Create a user group

User groups are a collection of users organized into a Microsoft Entra group. User groups can be either dynamic or assigned:

- **Dynamic groups** - Users are automatically added to the group based on rules.
- **Assigned groups** - Users are manually added to the group and are static.

Windows Autopilot device preparation uses a user group as part of the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy. The users that are members of the user group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy are the users that receive the Windows Autopilot device preparation deployment. The user group specified in the Windows Autopilot device preparation policy needs to be a security group but can be either an assigned or dynamic group.

To create a user security group for use with Windows Autopilot device preparation, follow these steps:
