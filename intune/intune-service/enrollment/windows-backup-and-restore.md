# Windows Backup for Organizations in Microsoft Intune    

*Applies to: Windows 10, Windows 11*  

Enable users to securely sync their settings to the cloud and restore them on new or reimaged devices. Together, Microsoft Intune and Windows Backup for Organization lets users back up your organization's Windows 10 or Windows 11 settings and restore them on a Microsoft Entra joined device during enrollment. The restore option is presented to users on its own screen during device enrollment.   

Windows Backup for Organizations is a feature that's comprised of the backup and restore settings and is an option that can: 

* Reduce migration overhead
* Minimize user disruption  
* Strengthen device resilience against incidents  
* Simplify your organization's transition to Windows 11

You can enable Windows backup and restore for devices in the Microsoft Intune admin center under **Devices** > **Enrollment**. After you turn on the restore option, users turning their devices on for the first time see the corresponding restore page during device enrollment. This is a tenant wide setting, so it applies to all users.  

## Benefits  

Windows Backup for Organizations ensures that users have a consistent and personalized experience across different devices. Benefits include:  

* Reduced troubleshooting: Confidently reset devices knowing that users can recover and return to previous settings.   
* Seamless experience: Smoothly transition from devices running Windows 10 to devices running Windows 11 using saved backups. 
* Enhanced productivity: Minimize downtime and maximize user productivity, whether resetting the device or reimaging, by restoring user settings to their preferred and familiar PC preferences.  

## Prerequisites 

To use the backup functionality, devices must be:  

* Microsoft Entra hybrid joined or Microsoft Entra joined.  
* Running a current supported version of either Windows 10 or Windows 11. Supported versions include:  
  * Windows 10, version 22H2, build 19045.5917 or later  
  * Windows 11, version 22H2, build 22621.5413 or later   
  * Windows 11, version 23H2, build 22631.5413 or later   
  * Windows 11, version 24H2, build 26100.4202 or later  â€¯  

The restore feature is available on devices that meet the following requirements:  

- Windows 11, version 22H2 or later.
- The device user must have at least one backup profile. 
- If Autopilot is used, the Autopilot profile must be configured to use [user-driven mode](), not self-deploying mode.  
- Must be [Microsoft Entra joined]().  

Additionally, you are required to configure these settings: 
- [AFS configuration]()
- [NDUP configuration]() must be turned on

## RBAC and tenant wide targeting 
The restore setting for Windows Backup for Organizations is a tenant-wide setting. This means the restore setting is either turned on or off for all Windows devices in a tenant. The default configuration is **Not configured**, which turns off the restore setting for all devices.  

To configure the restore setting, you must have Intune Service Administrator permissions.
