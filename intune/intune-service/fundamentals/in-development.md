# In development for Microsoft Intune

To help in your readiness and planning, this article lists Intune UI updates and features that are in development but not yet released. Also:

- If we anticipate that you'll need to take action before a change, we'll publish a complementary post in the Office message center.
- When a feature enters production, whether it's in preview or generally available, the feature description moves from this article to [What's new](whats-new.md).
- Refer to the [Microsoft 365 roadmap](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/roadmap?rtc=2&filters=EMS) for strategic deliverables and timelines.

This article and the [What's new](whats-new.md) article are updated periodically. Check back for more updates.

> [!NOTE]
> This article reflects our current expectations about Intune capabilities in an upcoming release. Dates and individual features might change. This article doesn't describe all features in development. It was last updated on the date shown under the title.

## App management

### Added protection for iOS/iPadOS app widgets<!-- 14614429 -->

To protect organizational data for MAM managed accounts and apps, Intune app protection policies will soon provide the capability to block data sync from policy managed app data to app widgets. App widgets can be added to end-user's iOS/iPadOS device lock screen, which can expose data contained by these widgets, such as meeting titles, top sites, and recent notes. In Intune, you'll be able to set the app protection policy setting **Sync policy managed app data with app widgets** to **Block** for iOS/iPadOS apps. This setting will be available as part of the **Data Protection** settings in app protection policies. This new setting will be an app protection feature similar to the **Sync policy managed app data with native app or add-ins** setting.

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS

## Device management

### Remote actions with multiple administrative approval<!-- 27043113  -->

Intune *access policies* help protect against a compromised administrative account by requiring that a second administrative account is used to approve a change before the change is applied. This capability is known as multiple administrative approval (MAA). The remote action **Wipe** will support MAA. Onboarding Remote device actions to MAA will help mitigate the risk of unauthorized or compromised remote actions being taken on devices by a single administrative account thereby enhancing the overall security posture of the environment.

For more information on multiple administrative approval, see [Use multiple administrative approvals in Intune](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).

### Introducing platform level targeting of Device Cleanup rule<!-- 13835920 -->

We're adding a feature that allows a customer to:

- Configure one device cleanup rule per platform (Windows, iOS/macOS, iPadOS, Android, Linux)
- Configure a different RBAC permission and assign the permission to different RBAC roles

Platform level targeting of the Device Cleanup rule helps administrators to remove stale and inactive devices from their tenant based on the active days rule specified by the admin. Scoped and targeted Device cleanup rules add an intermediate stage where an admin will be able to target removing stale devices by having a rule configured at the platform or OS level.

For more information, see [device cleanup rules](../remote-actions/devices-wipe.md#automatically-hide-devices-with-cleanup-rules).

<!-- *********************************************** -->

## Device security

### Support for Intune Device control policy for devices managed by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint<!-- 15466620 -->

You'll be able to use the endpoint security policy for *Device control* (Attack surface reduction policy) from the Microsoft Intune with the devices you manage through the [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint security settings management](../protect/mde-security-integration.md) capability.

- **Device control** policies are part of endpoint security [Attack surface reduction policy](../protect/endpoint-security-asr-policy.md).

Applies to the following when you use the *Windows* platform:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

When this change takes effect, devices that are assigned this policy while managed by Defender for Endpoint but not enrolled with Intune, will now apply the settings from the policy. Check your policy to make sure only the devices you intend to receive this policy will get it.

<!-- ## Intune apps -->

## Monitor and troubleshoot

### Declarative Apple software update report<!-- 31557946 -->

You'll soon be able to view near real time, rich reporting for operating system updates on Apple devices using the new Apple software updates report located under *Reports* > *Apple updates*. Using the new report, you'll be able to see:

- Pending OS update information such as OS and build version, and its status on the device
- Current OS information for a device
- Information about past software updates on the device
- Install reasons that describe how an update was triggered, for example, by the user or enforced through DDM
- Information about the latest public update made available by Apple
- Devices that have been patched with a Rapid Security Response, or have a Rapid Security Response available

Applies to:

- iOS/iPadOS
- macOS
