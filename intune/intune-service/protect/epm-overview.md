# Use Endpoint Privilege Management with Microsoft Intune

[!INCLUDE [intune-add-on-note](../includes/intune-add-on-note.md)]

With Microsoft Intune **Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM)** your organization's users can run as a standard user (without administrator rights) and complete tasks that require elevated privileges. Tasks that commonly require administrative privileges are application installs (like Microsoft 365 Applications), updating device drivers, and running certain Windows diagnostics.

Endpoint Privilege Management supports your [Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) journey by helping your organization achieve a broad user base running with least privilege, while allowing users to still run tasks allowed by your organization to remain productive. For more information, see [Zero Trust with Microsoft Intune](../fundamentals/zero-trust-with-microsoft-intune.md).

This overview provides information about EPM including the benefits, how it works, and how to get started.

Applies to:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11

## Key Features and Benefits

✅ Find out the key features and benefits of EPM

- **Standard Users by Default**. Users can perform their tasks without local admin rights.
- **Support for Just-in-time elevation**. Users elevate temporarily for specific IT-approved tasks, with automatic, user confirmed, or support approved elevations.
- **Policy-Based Control**. Admins define settings and rules to control elevation conditions and behaviour, with granular rule creation capabilities to suit organizational needs.
- **Audit Logging and Reporting**. Intune logs every elevation with detailed metadata.
- **Alignment to Zero Trust principles** by enabling least privilege access and minimizing lateral movement risks.

## EPM Fundamentals

✅ Learn how EPM works

EPM elevation can be triggered using two methods:

- Automatically, or;
- User selected "Run with elevated access".

EPM can be configured using two types of policies:

- **Elevation rules policy** - defines elevation behavior for apps based on criteria.
- **Elevation settings policy** - controls the EPM client, reporting level and default elevation capability.

Both rules and policies can be targeted at groups of users or devices. To perform the elevation on the device, the EPM service uses a virtual account, which is isolated from the logged on users' account. Neither of these accounts are added to the local administrators group.

The EPM client is installed automatically when an *Elevation settings policy* is assigned to devices or users. The EPM client uses the 'Microsoft EPM Agent Service' service and stores it's binaries in the `"C:\Program Files\Microsoft EPM Agent"` directory.

This diagram shows a high level architecture of how the EPM client is triggered, checks for rules and then facilitates elevation:

### Elevation Types

EPM allows users without administrative privileges to run processes in the administrative context. When you create an elevation rule, that rule allows EPM to proxy the target of that rule to run with administrator privileges on the device. The result is that the application has *full administrative* capability on the device.

When you use Endpoint Privilege Management, there are a few options for elevation behavior:

- **Automatic**: For automatic elevation rules, EPM *automatically* elevates these applications without input from the user. Broad rules in this category can have widespread impact to the security posture of the organization.

- **User confirmed**: With user confirmed rules, end users use a new right-click context menu *Run with elevated access*. Administrators can require the user to perform extra validation using an authentication prompt, business justification, or both.

- **Support approved**: For support approved rules, end users must submit a request to approve an application. Once the request is submitted, an administrator can approve the request. Once the request is approved, the end user is notified that they can complete the elevation on the device. For more information about using this rule type, see [Support approved elevation requests](../protect/epm-support-approved.md).

- **Deny**: A deny rule identifies a file that EPM blocks from running in an elevated context. While we recommend use of file elevation rules to allow users to elevate specific files, a deny rule can help you ensure that certain files like known and potentially malicious software can't be run in an elevated context.

### Rule Capabilities

EPM elevation rules can be created based on one or more attributes including file name, path, etc. These are some examples of additional rule capabilities:

- **Child process controls** - When processes are elevated by EPM, you can control how the creation of child processes is governed by EPM, which allows you to have granular control over any subprocesses that might be created by your elevated application.

- **Argument support** - Allow only certain parameters for applications to be elevated.

- **File hash support** - Match the application based on the hash of the file.

- **Publisher certificate support** - Create rules that are based of trusting the publisher certificate of the application alongside other attributes.

### Supported file types

EPM supports elevating these types of files:

- Executable files with a `.exe` extension.
- Windows installer files with a `.msi` extension.
- PowerShell scripts with the `.ps1` extension.

### Reporting

EPM includes reports to help you prepare for, monitor and use the service. Reports are provided for unmanaged and managed elevations:

- **Unmanaged elevation**: All file elevations that happen without use of Endpoint Privilege Management. These elevations can happen when a user with administrative rights uses the Windows default action of *Run as administrator*.

- **Managed elevation**: Any elevation that Endpoint Privilege Management facilitates. Managed elevations include all elevations that EPM ends up facilitating for the standard user. These managed elevations could include elevations that happen as the result of an elevation rule or as part of default elevation action.

## Getting started with Endpoint Privilege Management

✅ Start using EPM

Endpoint Privilege Management (EPM) is built into Microsoft Intune, which means that all configuration is completed within the [Microsoft Intune Admin Center](https://intune.microsoft.com). When organizations get started with EPM, they use the following high-level process:

- **License EPM** - Before you can use Endpoint Privilege Management policies, you must license EPM in your tenant as an Intune add-on. For licensing information, see [Use Intune Suite add-on capabilities](../fundamentals/intune-add-ons.md).

- **Plan for EPM** - Before your start using EPM, there are some key requirements and concepts you should consider. For more information, see [Plan for EPM](epm-plan.md).

- **Deploy EPM** - To deploy EPM, enable auditing, create rules, and monitor the deployment. For more information, see [Deploy EPM](epm-deploy.md).
