# Configure Microsoft Intune for increased security (Preview)

In Microsoft Intune, the following security recommendations are presented across several categories. This structure allows organizations to logically break up projects into related consumable chunks.

> [!TIP]
> Some organizations might take these recommendations exactly as written, while others might choose to make modifications based on their own business needs.
>
> These recommendations should be considered distinct from the recommendations as found in the various security baselines that you might deploy with Intune.


<!-- Subsequent articles to use a similar name structure with actual names to TBD.  Initial proposed ToC structure:

Set up Microsoft Intune
 > URLs and IPI address endpoints
 > Set up Intune subscription
 > Manage roles and permissions
 > Configure security recommendations using Zero Trust  
   > Configure security recommendations using Zero Trust [../protect/zero-trust-configure-security.md]
   > Sub 1  [../protect/zero-trust-group1.md]
   > Sub 2  [../protect/zero-trust-group2.md]
