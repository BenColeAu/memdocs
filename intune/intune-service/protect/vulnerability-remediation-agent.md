# Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Microsoft Intune

In public preview, the Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Intune uses data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management) to identify the individual Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Windows vulnerabilities on your managed devices. The results are prioritized for remediation and include step-by-step instructions to guide you in using Intune to remediate the threat. This Copilot Agent can help you reduce the time it takes to investigate, identify, and remediate threats from hours to only a few minutes. 

When the agent runs, it analyzes the most recent CVE details and the device status from Defender for Endpoint to provide a prioritized list of the top threats. This list appears in the Intune admin center where you can drill-in to a listed threat to view details that include information about the risk and step-by-step guidance for using Intune to remediate it. Once remediated, you can mark the agent suggestion as applied to have the agent retain a record you can use in tracking remediation actions over time. 

Because CVE details and recommended remediation guidance can change over time, subsequent runs of the agent might provide new details, device counts, and remediation steps. As you manage subsequent reports of threats, the record of your previously applied solutions can help you track the change to specific risks based on your previous remediations.

For information about other Security Copilot Agents in Intune and common features, see [Security Copilot agents in Microsoft Intune](../copilot/security-copilot-agents-intune.md).

### Limitations

- An admin must manually start the agent. Once the agent starts, there are no options to stop or pause it.
- The agent runs in the context of the user who starts it.
- Only start the agent from within the Microsoft Intune admin center.

## Getting started

Complete the setup process to start the Vulnerability Remediation Agent for the first time: 

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) with an account that has the required [RBAC permissions](#role-based-access-control) and access to your tenants Security Copilot workspace.

2. On the **Home** screen of the admin center, find the **Get started with Security Copilot** banner and select the **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)** tile. The admin center opens the *Endpoint security* > *Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)* page:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/agent-set-up.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Intune admin center home page with the Vulnerability Remediation Agent tile." lightbox="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/agent-set-up.png":::

3. Select **Set up Agent** to open the set-up pane. This pane displays details about the agent but doesn’t require any configuration. Review the details to ensure requirements are in place, and then select **Start agent** to close the set-up pane and begin the first run of the agent.

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/set-up-and-start-agent.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Set up Vulnerability Remediation Agent page and the Start agent button." lightbox="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/set-up-and-start-agent.png":::

The agent runs until it finishes and then displays its results in the Vulnerability Remediation Agent pane of the admin center.

## Manage vulnerabilities and the agent

After the agent completes its initial run, you can review and manage the Vulnerability Remediation Agent suggestions In the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)**. By default, the agent page opens to the [Overview](#overview-tab) tab. On this tab you can view the prioritized list of vulnerabilities, drill in for more details and remediation steps, and view the agent run history. 

The other available tab is [Settings](#settings-tab) tab, which provides limited details about the agent’s configuration. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/agent-home-screen.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Remediation Agent home page in the admin center." lightbox="agent-home-screen.png":::

### Overview tab

After the Vulnerability Remediation Agent completes a run, the Overview tab updates with the agents prioritized list of the top 100 vulnerabilities.

The following information is available on this tab:

- The agent’s availability and status
- Agent suggestions, which are the prioritized list of vulnerabilities. 
- The list of past agent activity.

#### Agent suggestions

Agent suggestions are the prioritized list of the top 100 vulnerabilities that Security Copilot identified based on the data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management). The list presents the same information you would see in the Microsoft Defender console.

This list also displays the following column details:

- **Suggested next steps:** Each *suggested next step* is a link that opens a *Suggested action* pane. On the *Suggested action* pane, are details about the vulnerability, suggested actions to take to use Intune to remediate the threat, and an option to mark the remediation as *Applied*. 

  Remediation guidance falls into the following categories:

  - **Apps** - To remediate apps the agent might recommend deployment of an updated app, or of an Intune profile to help you manage what the app can do or be used to do that represents a threat.
  - **Windows** – To remediate Windows vulnerabilities, common recommendations include deployment of a device configuration profile or the deployment of a windows update that resolves the threat.

    When a recommendation involves a Windows update, the agents guidance includes details about the use of [update rings](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) to help you manage a more controlled rollout of the update.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >
    > Some suggested Windows updates recommendations begin with **Expedite**. The agent uses this format when the CVE’s Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score reaches a risk value of **9.0** or greater. For this level of risk, the agent recommends expediting these updates to your devices immediately. To help you deploy these more critical updates, the guidance includes how to use [Expedited installation of quality updates](../protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md), to more rapidly deploy the recommended update.

  The following image is an example of the *Suggested action* pane for an App vulnerability. In this example, the recommendation is to update the app to a newer version:

  :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/suggested-action-pane.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Suggested actions for an App vulnerability." lightbox="suggested-action-pane.png":::

  After reviewing the agent suggestions and implementing a recommended remediation, you can self-attest to the implementation of the recommendation by selecting **Mark as applied** for app vulnerabilities, or **Mark update as applied** for Windows updates.

  While optional, we recommend you mark a suggested action as applied to help track when that suggested remediation is implemented. Recommendations marked as applied will persist in the agent suggestions list where they can serve as a baseline for future runs of the agent allowing you to compare new results and changes for that same vulnerability.

- **Impact:** This value identifies the [exposure score](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-exposure-score) as provided by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

- **Exposed devices:** The count of affected devices.

- **Status:** By default, a reported vulnerability has its status set to *Not applied*. After you drill in to a reported vulnerability to review and deploy the suggested remediation, you can select the option to mark that suggestion as applied, which changes the status of the agent’s suggestion to *Applied*.

- **Last applied:** This value identifies the date and time that an admin selected the option to mark the remediation guidance as applied.

#### Activity

This section tracks the current and past run activity of the agent. When the agent is still actively running, the Status column displays *Run in progress*. The status column displays *Complete* for past agent runs. 

### Settings tab

On the Vulnerability Remediation Agent **Settings** tab, you can view the existing details about the current configuration of the agent. During the public preview, there are no edits or changes you can make. 

### Run the agent

The Vulnerability Remediation Agent doesn’t support a recurring schedule and must be started manually. 

To start and run the agent, in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)** and select **Run**. This option isn’t available until after the agent is [set-up](#getting-started) and completes its first run.

After the agent starts to run, it runs until it completes its evaluation. It can't be stopped or paused.

### Remove the agent

To remove the Vulnerability Remediation Agent, in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) , go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)** and select **Remove agent**. After you accept the prompt, the agent is removed, and the agent pane is restored to its original state. 

Later, you can run through the agent [set-up](#getting-started) to reinstall it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> When you remove the agent, the data generated by the agent including suggestions and activities are deleted. The agent doesn’t delete suggestions that are marked as *Applied*. These are kept as a permanent record but aren't visible until the agent is reinstalled.
