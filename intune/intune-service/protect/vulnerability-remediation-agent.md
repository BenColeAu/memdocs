# Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Microsoft Intune

In public preview, the Vulnerability Remediation Agent for Security Copilot in Intune uses data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management) to identify Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) on your managed devices. The results are prioritized for remediation and include step-by-step instructions to guide you in using Intune to remediate the threat. This Copilot Agent can help you reduce the time it takes to investigate, identify, and remediate threats, ultimately improving your organization’s overall security posture.

When the agent runs, it analyzes the most recent CVE recommendation details and the device status from Defender for Endpoint to provide a prioritized list of the top threats. The agent outputs a list of suggestions that appear in the Intune admin center. You can drill-in to each suggestion to view details that include:

- The count of associated vulnerabilities
- A summarized impact analysis
- Suggested actions 
- Affected systems
- Exposed devices
- Potential impact
- Step-by-step guidance for using Intune to remediate it

Once you remediate an agent suggestion, you can mark it as applied to have the agent retain a record you can use in tracking remediation actions over time.


Because CVE details and recommended remediation guidance can change over time, subsequent runs of the agent might provide new details, device counts, and remediation steps. As you manage subsequent reports of threats, the record of your previously applied solutions can help you track the change to specific risks based on your previous remediations.

## Getting started

Complete the setup process to start the Vulnerability Remediation Agent for the first time: 

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) with an account that has the required [RBAC permissions](#role-based-access-control) and access to your tenants Security Copilot workspace.

2. On the **Home** screen of the admin center, find the **Get started with Security Copilot** banner and select the **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)** tile. The admin center opens the *Endpoint security* > *Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)* page:

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/agent-set-up.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Intune admin center home page with the Vulnerability Remediation Agent tile.":::

3. Select **Set up Agent** to open the set-up pane. This pane displays details about the agent but doesn’t require any configuration. Review the details to ensure requirements are in place, and then select **Start agent** to close the set-up pane and begin the first run of the agent.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only with a user in the owner role in Security Copilot can create or delete the agent instance. Contributors can run the agent and view results but can't do agent instance management. 

   :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/set-up-and-start-agent.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Set up Vulnerability Remediation Agent page and the Start agent button.":::

The agent runs until it finishes and then displays its results in the Vulnerability Remediation Agent pane of the admin center.

## Manage vulnerabilities and the agent

After the agent completes its initial run, you can review and manage the Vulnerability Remediation Agent suggestions In the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431) go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)**. By default, the agent page opens to the [Overview](#overview-tab) tab. On this tab you can view the prioritized list of vulnerabilities, drill in for more details and remediation steps, and view the agent run history. 

The other available tab is [Settings](#settings-tab) tab, which provides limited details about the agent’s configuration. 

:::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/agent-home-screen.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Remediation Agent home page in the admin center.":::

### Overview tab

After the Vulnerability Remediation Agent completes a run, the Overview tab updates with the agents prioritized list of the top 100 vulnerabilities.

The following information is available on this tab:

- The agent’s availability and run status
- Agent suggestions, which are the prioritized list of vulnerabilities. 
- The list of past agent activity.

#### Agent suggestions

Agent suggestions are a prioritized list of the top 100 vulnerabilities that Security Copilot identified based on the data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management). This information can differ slightly from the same information you would see in the Microsoft Defender console.

This list also displays the following column details:

- **Suggested next steps:** Each *suggested next step* is a link that opens a *Suggested action* pane. On the *Suggested action* pane are details about the associated vulnerabilities (for Intune managed devices), suggested actions to take to use Intune to remediate the threat, and an option to mark the remediation as *Applied*. 

  Remediation guidance falls into the following categories:

  - **Apps** - To remediate apps the agent might recommend deployment of an updated app, or of an Intune profile to help you manage what the app can do or be used to do that represents a threat.
  - **Windows** – To remediate Windows vulnerabilities, common recommendations include deployment of a quality update policy or the expedited deployment of a quality update policy using Windows update rings to resolve the threat.

    When a recommendation involves a Windows update, the agents guidance includes details about the use of [update rings](../protect/windows-10-update-rings.md) to help you manage a more controlled rollout of the update.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Some suggested Windows updates recommendations begin with **Expedite**. The agent uses this format when the CVE’s Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score reaches a risk value of **9.0** or greater. For this level of risk, the agent recommends expediting these updates to your devices immediately. To help you deploy these more critical updates, the guidance includes how to use [Expedited installation of quality updates](../protect/windows-10-expedite-updates.md), to more rapidly deploy the recommended update.

  The following image is an example of the *Suggested action* pane for an App vulnerability. In this example, the recommendation is to update the app to a newer version:

  :::image type="content" source="./media/vulnerability-remediation-agent/suggested-action-pane.png" alt-text="A screenshot that displays the Suggested actions for an App vulnerability.":::

  After reviewing agent suggestions and applying a recommended remediation, you can self-attest to applying those remediations by selecting **Mark as applied**. This action confirms that the remediation steps are complete. Marking a suggestion as applied doesn’t trigger any device changes by the agent but does add a timestamp called *Last marked as applied* to the suggestion that identifies the time of that attestation.

  With subsequent runs of the agent, suggestions might be updated. If the previous suggestion was marked as applied, you can self-attest to having applied the more recent suggestions by selecting **Make update as applied**. This action updates the *Last marked as applied* timestamp to the current time.

  While optional, marking a suggested action as applied helps track when a suggested remediation was implemented. Recommendations marked as applied persist in the agent suggestions list, serving as a baseline for future runs of the agent, allowing you to compare new results and changes for that same vulnerability.

- **Impact:** This value is the potential impact on your [exposure score](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-exposure-score) as identified by Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management.

- **Exposed devices:** The count of affected devices. The associated CVEs number count shown by the agent is only for devices with Windows 10 and Windows 11 client operating system editions and doesn't include server editions. The devices listed in the Export to .csv removes any devices not found in Microsoft Entra. 

  > [!TIP]
  > The agent does not support scope tags during the public preview.


- **Status:** By default, a reported vulnerability has its status set to *Not applied*. After you drill in to a reported vulnerability to review and deploy the suggested remediation, you can select the option to mark that suggestion as applied, which changes the status of the agent’s suggestion to *Applied*. *Mark as applied* confirms that you’re self-attesting that you completed the remediation steps. No action is taken on devices by the agent.

- **Last applied:** This value identifies the date and time that an admin selected the option to mark the remediation guidance as applied.

#### Activity

This section tracks the current and past run activity of the agent. When the agent is still actively running, the Status column displays *Run in progress*. The status column displays *Complete* for past agent runs. 

### Settings tab

On the Vulnerability Remediation Agent **Settings** tab, you can view the existing details about the current configuration of the agent. During the public preview, there are no edits or changes you can make. 

### Run the agent

To start and run the Vulnerability Remediation Agent, in the [Intune admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2109431), go to **Endpoint security** > **Vulnerability Remediation Agent (preview)** and select **Run**. This option isn’t available until after the agent is [set-up](#getting-started) and completes its first run.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The agent persistently runs in the identity of the user who initially set up the agent.

The Vulnerability Remediation Agent doesn’t support a recurring schedule and must be started manually.

Once started, the agent runs until it completes its evaluation. It can’t be stopped or paused.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you remove the agent:
> - Data that was generated by the agent including suggestions and activities are deleted. 
> - If the agent is deleted, all of the sessions are stored for 90 days.

> [!NOTE]
> To remove the agent instance, your account must have the *Owner* role in Security Copilot. An account with the *Contributor* role can run the agent and view results but can't manage the agent instance.

Later, you can run through the agent [set-up](#getting-started) to reinstall it.

## Vulnerability Remediation Agent Identity

The agent runs under the identity of the user who initiated the instance. During public preview, the identity can't be edited. To change this identity, the agent must be uninstalled and then reinstalled.

## Vulnerability Remediation Agent logs

During the public preview, there are limited logs available for the agent.

All agent management, create, delete, run, and any permission failures are available in [Security Copilot logs](/copilot/security/audit-log).
Logging of discovered vulnerabilities or when a remediation was applied aren't available. Instead, use the options to mark remediated a vulnerability as *Applied*.
