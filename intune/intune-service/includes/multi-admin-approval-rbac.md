Multi-administrator approval (MAA) now supports role-based access control. When enabled, any changes to roles, including modifications to role permissions, admin groups, or member group assignments, require a second administrator to approve the change before it's applied. This dual authorization process helps protect your organization from unauthorized or accidental role-based access control changes. For more information, see [Use multiple administrative approvals in Intune](../fundamentals/multi-admin-approval.md).
