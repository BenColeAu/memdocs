# Microsoft Security Copilot agents in Microsoft Intune

Microsoft Security Copilot agents are available in Microsoft Intune.

## Available agents

### Vulnerability Remediation Agent in Microsoft Intune

The [Vulnerability Remediation Agent in Intune](../protect/vulnerability-remediation-agent.md) uses data from [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management) to identify the individual Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) and Windows vulnerabilities on your managed devices. The results are prioritized for remediation and include step-by-step instructions to guide you in using Intune to remediate the threat. Use of this Copilot Agent by your security team can help you reduce the time it takes to investigate, identify, and remediate threats from hours to only a few minutes.

Use of this Copilot Agent by your security team can reduce the time it takes to investigate, identify, and remediate threats from hours to only a few minutes.

#### Trigger

The Vulnerability Remediation Agent runs manually, on demand.

#### Permissions

The Vulnerability Remediation Agent runs using the identity of the user who installed the agent in Intune. To change this identity, the agent must be uninstalled, and then reinstalled.

#### Identity

The agent persistently runs in the identity of the user who initially set up the agent.

#### Products

The agent requires the following products:

- [Microsoft Intune Plan 1 subscription](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-intune-pricing?msockid=2da59cedebdd644e10a289a7ea67657a) *This subscription provides the core Intune capabilities*.
- [Microsoft Intune Suite](https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-intune-pricing?msockid=2da59cedebdd644e10a289a7ea67657a) - *Intune Suite standalone solution add-on licenses including Intune Endpoint Privilege Management, Enterprise Application Management, and Intune Plan 2 do not meet this prerequisite.*
- [Microsoft Security Copilot](/copilot/security/microsoft-security-copilot) - *Security Copilot must share a Tenant with Intune, and you must have sufficient SCUs to power Security Copilot workloads, including agents.*
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](../protect/advanced-threat-protection.md) *This capability is provided by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2 or Defender Vulnerability Management Standalone.*

#### Plugins

- Microsoft Intune
- [Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management](/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management)

#### Role-based access

For an Intune administrator (admin) to successfully manage or use the Vulnerability Remediation Agent, they must be assigned the role-based access controls (RBAC) for Intune, Microsoft Defender, and Security Copilot as described in the following sections.

When assigning RBAC roles and permissions to admins to manage and use the agent, assign the least privileged built-in RBAC role or a custom role that includes the minimum permissions ï¿¼required to complete their administrative tasks.

> The Vulnerability Remediation Agent runs under the identity of the admin who set up the agent. During public preview, the identity can't be edited. To change this identity, the agent must be removed and set up again.
>
> Data that is reported by the agent and visible through agent suggestions might be visible to admins with access to view the agent within the Intune admin center, even when that data is outside the admins assigned Intune roles or scope.
